# AI for Autonomous Navigation - Tesla

## Some autonomous systems in use
Vaccum robots are some of the most successful home robots in use. Some vaccum robot models like iRobot Roomba (launched in 2002) use a camera for [visual SLAM](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/09/16/247936/the-roomba-now-sees-and-maps-a-home/) (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), other models like Neato D10 use 2D Lidar for SLAM. Use of a Lidar indoors allows it to work in dark areas, enables faster mapping and affords more privacy for residents. Neato Robotics after 18 years is now being shutdown due to underperformance. iRobot has been acquired by Amazon leading to monopoly and more privacy concerns.
